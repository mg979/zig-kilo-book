# Conclusion

I hope you found it interesting and/or useful.

Credits and thanks:

- Andrew Kelley for creating the Zig programming language
- Users of the Ziggit forum for answering questions
- Especially user [@vulpesx](https://ziggit.dev/u/vulpesx) for advices on making the code more idiomatic for Zig
- Paige Ruten, the writer of the [original booklet](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)
- Salvatore Sanfilippo, the author of the original [kilo editor](https://github.com/antirez/kilo)

With that I don't mean the code is perfect, as I wrote in the introduction, but
I did my best.

If you find mistakes, oversights or bad/wrong explanations of language
concepts/features, please post an issue.

Thanks for reading.
